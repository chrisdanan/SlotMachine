Anime Slot Machine Version 1.0 06/25/15

INTRODUCTION
---------------------------------------

This project is a simple slot machine game. I started working on it in order to strengthen my skills that I learned while taking my Web Development and Applications course at school. I wanted to also experiment with some ideas that I did not have time to explore while in school, such as using sounds and images.

This project does not use a server or database; it is a simple web page application using JavaScript. I may in the future incorporate a server and database, but for now I just want it to be as simple as can be.
